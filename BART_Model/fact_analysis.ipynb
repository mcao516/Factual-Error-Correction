      "A not-for-profit group that organised seminars featuring US anti-vaccination campaigner Sherri Tenpenny before she had to cancel due to threats of violence has had its charity status cancelled. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) made the announcement about Get Rid of Sids Project on Wednesday. The organisation is run by well-known Brisbane anti-vaccination campaigner Stephanie Messenger who has penned a number of children's books, including Melanie's Marvelous Measles. Scroll down for video . Get Rid of Sids, which had been organising events featuring anti-vaccination campaign Sherri Tenpenny, has had its charity status revoked . In a statement, the ACNC said it had revoked Get Rid of Sids Project's charity status after a review into its operations and activities. The decision was effective from April 1 and the organisation had 60 days to lodge an appeal. The ACNC was unable to provide any more details of why this had happened because of 'secrecy provisions' within its Act. This means Get Rid of Sids Project will lose its right to tax concessions and its deductible gift recipient status. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the organisation for comment. Earlier this year, Get Rid of Sids Project ran into controversy when it invited Dr Tenpenny to speak at a number of seminars across Australia. The organisation is headed by prominent Brisbane anti-vaccination campaigner Stephanie Messenger . Her planned trip caused uproar and was repeatedly boycotted by Australian doctors and venues. Following a number of cancellations, Dr Tenpenny made the decision to cancel her remaining talks due to consistent threats of violence from 'anti-free-speech terrorists'. Sherri Tenpenny was due to speak at a number of events in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and the Gold Coast. In a statement posted to social media at the time, she cited a number of reasons why she had decided not to come to Australia, saying a large number of violent threats, including bomb threats, had been made against venue owners and their families. 'The determination was made to protect the speakers, the public and the venue owners as pro-vaccine extremists have made continual, anonymous threats of vandalism and violence,' the statement read. Earlier this year, Get Rid of Sids Project ran into controversy when it invited Dr Tenpenny to speak at a number of seminars across Australia . Dr Tenpenny revealed that she had also cancelled a private holiday in Australia due to concerns for her own personal safety. 'I was coming to speak as an invited guest. However, given the level of hostility that has transpired over the last three weeks, and for the sake of my own personal safety, I have also cancelled my planned vacation in Australia,' she said. Stephanie Messenger, who heads Get Rid of Sids Project and had invited Dr Tenpenny to speak, is the controversial author ofÂ Melanie's Marvelous Measles. The message of the book, which tells children having the measles is fun, was panned by reviewers on Amazon. Messenger said the aim of her book was to 'educate children on the benefits of having measles and how you can heal from them naturally and successfully'. But people on the internet had other ideas about her picture book, with the book receiving 872 ratings of one star. While the reviews sarcastically thanked Messenger for her contribution.\n"
